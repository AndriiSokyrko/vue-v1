# Synopsis

``` javascript
var tough = require('tough-cookie');
var Cookie = tough.Cookie;
var cookie = Cookie.parse(header);
cookie.value = 'somethingdifferent';
header = cookie.toString();

var cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();
cookiejar.setCookie(cookie, 'http://currentdomain.example.com/path', cb);
// ...
cookiejar.getCookies('http://example.com/otherpath',function(err,cookies) {
  res.headers['cookie'] = cookies.join('; ');
});
```

Support for versions of node.js will follow that of the [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) module.

### `canonicalDomain(str)`

Transforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of
